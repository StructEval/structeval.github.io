\textbf{Rule Type} & \textbf{Example} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Literal key access & \texttt{planet.name} & Checks if key \texttt{name} exists as a child of object \texttt{planet}. \\
Nested lists with index & \texttt{planet.moons[0].name} & Verifies first item in \texttt{moons} list has a \texttt{name} field. \\
Wildcard in lists & \texttt{planet.moons.*.name} & Confirms that \texttt{name} exists for \textit{any} moon in the list. \\
Backtick quoting & \texttt{data.`key.with.dots`} & Treats entire quoted token as a single key, useful for special characters. \\
CSV header check & \texttt{csv::discovery.location} & Ensures CSV output has a column named \texttt{discovery.location}. \\
XML attribute fallback & \texttt{@id} & Looks for \texttt{id} attribute, using \texttt{@} to indicate XML format. \\
