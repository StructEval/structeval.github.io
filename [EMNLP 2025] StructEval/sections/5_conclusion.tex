\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have comprehensively studied LLMs' abilities to generate highly structured content. Having the ability to generate fully structured content is highly useful for many downstream tasks. Our paper is among the first few to provide an evaluation suite for that. Our results indicate that current models are still lagging on the renderable structured content, especially on less frequent format. We advocate that the future models should invest more time to optimize their abilities to generate highly structured output.
